## Magic: Return of the mages

It's proof of concept of dungeon crawler game. You may select your character (mage, paladin or warlock), which differ by their stats. Then level-by-level confront with different type of creatures (starting pig up to demons and dragons). Hero can use melee attack or magic. Most interesting part here is magic mechanics. Player "cast" spells by mixing of magic type (air, fire, ground, water, spirit). Mix of elements it may produce different spell. Or not... because of player stats, mana power or interruption of enemy. When player rise his level, more powerful and dangerous spells opens (mix of three elements). And he can use it if he want. Some monsters have immunity to some attacks as well as weakness.
